title: About Ashley M. Miller
---

I started teaching myself how to code websites when I was 11 years old.  I started off making tiny little fandom sites (and I was even featured in a DBZ magazine).  When I got to college, I went in expecting to get a degree in graphic design.  It wasn\'t for me and I ultimately switched to Psychology, though I did serve as web designer for a handful of clubs.  I got a couple psychology degrees and decided that, again, a traditional path wasn\'t for me.

With the help of former professors and a lot of internet research, I stumbled on the UX field. It seemed like this field was made for me.  I applied and joined the Human-Computer Interaction degree at DePaul University and I\'m looking forward to learning all I can.

> **[Attachment Styles and Aggressor-Victim Relationships in Preadolescence]({{ base.url}}/images/thesis.pdf)**  
The current study investigated the change in relationship between an aggressor\'s attachment style and a series of characteristics in their victims over a school year. Participants rated themselves and their classmates on 16 personality characteristics and their aggression levels against other students. Only avoidant girls significantly refined their targets over the course of a school year.

###Bachelor of Science, Psychology _Bradley University, 2006-2010_

> **[Psychopathic Tendencies Related to SES Across Nations]({{ base.url}}/images/sesposter.pdf)**  
Psychopathic tendencies, including callous affect, lack of empathy, and criminality, have been shown to increase during high stress situations and low stress situations. When compared to socioeconomic statuses (SES), individuals in a lower SES and in a higher SES would show higher psychopathic tendencies than those in moderate SES. Data from the ISDP-2 showed that this prediction was true only for the Criminality subscale of psychopathy and in wealthier nations, like the United States.
