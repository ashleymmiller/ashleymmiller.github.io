_This is a backdated post._

Very shortly after beginning my job at [Lake County](http://www.lakecountyil.gov/), I told my boss that my goal was to get Lake County a [GovTech award](http://www.govtech.com/cdg/digital-government-achievement/).  Redesigning the front page is the first step towards that goal.

##The Old

<a href="{{ base.url }}/images/lcilfront_old.jpg"><img src="{{ base.url }}/images/lcilfront_old.jpg" class="right half" alt="Old front page" /></a> The old layout was a mishmash of icons and images and styles and while it kind of contained a whole bunch of information, it was missing context.  It was definitely ugly.  The image to the right is a screenshot from the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) and though some of the images are broken, it definitely captures the overwhelming feeling of the old front page.

##The New

###The Tabs

The initial sketches were primarily inspired by GovTech winner [Alameda County, CA](http://www.acgov.org/).  We wanted to create tabs so that we could still have a lot of information on the main page, without overwhelming the visitors.

We used statistics from [Siteimprove](http://siteimprove.com/) to determine what exactly should exist on the front page.  The main thing we ended up removing was the slideshow.  In about a year, each slideshow story had only gotten tens of hits, out of over a million visitors. Due to politics, there were some things we couldn\'t get rid of entirely, but we could move them.  

We used those same statistics to help us determine what those tabs should be broken down into.  Ultimately, we ended up with News, County Board, Property Tax, Jobs & Doing Business, Services, Connect, and Transparency.  Most of the links were reorganized into those categories and then we added a lot more.  

We ended up with a lot more information, but also a lot more context.  For example, one of the old links said \"Transparency/OpenGov\".  There was no context to what OpenGov meant, even when paired with Transparency.  The new tab now describes transparency initiatives and provides links to all of the items mentioned.

###Top 10 Searches, What\'s Trending, and Featured Videos

The bottom bar replaced the red sidebar from the old layout.  The information was expanded.  Top 10 Searches is kind of self-explanatory and is manually updated once a week.  What\'s Trending describes new initiatives in the county.  (This one could be better named, I think.)  And Featured Videos is also self-explanatory.

###Header and Footer

What I could do personally with the Header and Footer was limited.  Changes were either mocked-up in Photoshop or coded quickly with Notepad and then handed off to the Sharepoint admin for final changes.  We wanted to make the search bar more prominent, add a pop-up for people to sign up for all newsletters available in the county, and we wanted to expand the footer.

##What\'s Next?

I\'m currently in the process of condensing the top navigation so that users do not have to hover through many layers of drop-down menus.  We've also put in a request for funding for a new <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> that gets us away from Sharepoint.  That will also give us the opportunity to completely redo the layout, which will only get us closer
