<a href="{{ base.url }}/images/fpc_old.jpg"><img src="{{ base.url }}/images/fpc_old.jpg" class="right half" alt="Old front page" /></a>The [ForeFront Packaging Consultants (FPC)](http://fpcpackaging.com/) website was in need of a complete overhaul.  While preparations were being made for the rebranding, I performed minor updates to the old website, pictured on the right.

[Frederick Vallarta](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/frederick-z-vallarta/32/162/817) created the logo and inspired by it and other professional websites, an employee and I started to redesign the website.  We went through many sketches, some of which are pictured below, until we came across an image (collected as part of a mood/idea board) that inspired the blue waves.  The layout kind of fell into place after that point.

From there, we continued to go through many revisions.  I coded the layout by hand originally, so we could hammer out many of the details before deciding on a <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>.  Ultimately we went with [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) and I translated the layout into a theme.

To make [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) do exactly what <abbr title="ForeFront Packaging Consultants">FPC</abbr> wanted, we added a handful of plugins:

- [CP Google Maps](http://wordpress.dwbooster.com/content-tools/codepeople-post-map)
- [Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/)
- [Ninja Forms](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/)
- [Simple Image Sizes](https://github.com/Rahe/'simple-image-sizes')
- [Slideshow](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/slideshow-jquery-image-gallery/)
- [WP Gallery Custom Links](http://www.fourlightsweb.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-gallery-custom-links/)

And the system is easy enough for the employees to add and change content as necessary, though changing layout elements still requires someone familiar with HTML and CSS.
