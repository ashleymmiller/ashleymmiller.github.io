_This is a backdated post._

The [Veterans Assistance Commission (VAC) website](http://www.lakecountyil.gov/Veterans/Pages/default.aspx) was a large project.  They are a small, overworked department at Lake County and were in need of help on many different communications aspect.  They asked other members of the Communications department to create a brochure for them and I took the opportunity to redesign their website at the same time.

##The Problem

Though there are a lot of amazing services for veterans at the <abbr title="Veterans Assistance Commission">VAC</abbr>, you would not know it from the original website.  It had so few pages I could count them on only two hands and the information was not presented in an easy, readable format.

##The Process

The first step to this project was to completely reorganize and rewrite all of their information.  I created a list of the content we were going to put on the site and then organized it in a manner that would have made sense to outsiders.  I am unable to know each and every department in the county at an intimate level, so I have a unique outsider perspective.  We also gathered photos from <abbr title="Veterans Assistance Commission">VAC</abbr> events, so that monotonous text could be broken up.

###The Front Page

As is every project at Lake County, it was an exercise in designing with restrictions.  I am unable to change the overall layout, like the top navigation, styling of sidebars, or the footer.
  I was able to create a [pleasing landing page](http://www.lakecountyil.gov/Veterans/Pages/default.aspx) that displays the categories (and a subtitle to give context), allows the members of the <abbr title="Veterans Assistance Commission">VAC</abbr> to promote new services, and also gives users a brief introduction to the <abbr title="Veterans Assistance Commission">VAC</abbr>.

###Eligibility

[This page](http://www.lakecountyil.gov/Veterans/Pages/Eligibility.aspx) did not exist on the original site, so veterans looking to find eligibility were forced to call the <abbr title="Veterans Assistance Commission">VAC</abbr> to find the information they were looking for.  This table cleanly displays elibility status.

###Applications

[This page](http://www.lakecountyil.gov/Veterans/Pages/Applications.aspx) condenses all application information into one page.  The application is clearly listed at the top and is no longer lost in the middle of a whole bunch of text.  The bottom two sections (Required Documents and How to Request DD214) are new to the site.

###Assistance

[This section](http://www.lakecountyil.gov/Veterans/Assistance/Pages/default.aspx) required the most work because very little of this information was available on the original website.  We wrote, rewrote, and reorganized everything into meaningful categories.

###About the VAC

I learned even more about Sharepoint while developing the [About section](http://www.lakecountyil.gov/Veterans/About/Pages/default.aspx).  The About section lists agendas, minutes, and reports from various meetings and the staff had issues remembering how to appropriately post PDFs to their website.  To ease their work load, I used a webpart to list tagged documents in a specific order.

###Affiliated Groups

[The content on Affiliated Groups](http://www.lakecountyil.gov/Veterans/Affiliates/Pages/default.aspx) was easy to organize.  It is primarily made of links to the affiliated groups, though there are actual pages if the group submitted a write-up.

##Final Thoughts

When we showed the finished product to the <abbr title="Veterans Assistance Commission">VAC</abbr>, they asked if we could make it live today.  I call that a rousing success.

Though I still have issues with Sharepoint as an external website <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>, it did provide solutions to the content editors problems.
