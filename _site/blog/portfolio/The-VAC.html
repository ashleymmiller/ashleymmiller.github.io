<p><em>This is a backdated post.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lakecountyil.gov/Veterans/Pages/default.aspx">Veterans Assistance Commission (VAC) website</a> was a large project.  They are a small, overworked department at Lake County and were in need of help on many different communications aspect.  They asked other members of the Communications department to create a brochure for them and I took the opportunity to redesign their website at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Though there are a lot of amazing services for veterans at the <abbr title="Veterans Assistance Commission">VAC</abbr>, you would not know it from the original website.  It had so few pages I could count them on only two hands and the information was not presented in an easy, readable format.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>

<p>The first step to this project was to completely reorganize and rewrite all of their information.  I created a list of the content we were going to put on the site and then organized it in a manner that would have made sense to outsiders.  I am unable to know each and every department in the county at an intimate level, so I have a unique outsider perspective.  We also gathered photos from <abbr title="Veterans Assistance Commission">VAC</abbr> events, so that monotonous text could be broken up.</p>

<h3 id="the-front-page">The Front Page</h3>

<p>As is every project at Lake County, it was an exercise in designing with restrictions.  I am unable to change the overall layout, like the top navigation, styling of sidebars, or the footer.
  I was able to create a <a href="http://www.lakecountyil.gov/Veterans/Pages/default.aspx">pleasing landing page</a> that displays the categories (and a subtitle to give context), allows the members of the <abbr title="Veterans Assistance Commission">VAC</abbr> to promote new services, and also gives users a brief introduction to the <abbr title="Veterans Assistance Commission">VAC</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.lakecountyil.gov/Veterans/Pages/Eligibility.aspx">This page</a> did not exist on the original site, so veterans looking to find eligibility were forced to call the <abbr title="Veterans Assistance Commission">VAC</abbr> to find the information they were looking for.  This table cleanly displays elibility status.</p>

<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.lakecountyil.gov/Veterans/Pages/Applications.aspx">This page</a> condenses all application information into one page.  The application is clearly listed at the top and is no longer lost in the middle of a whole bunch of text.  The bottom two sections (Required Documents and How to Request DD214) are new to the site.</p>

<h3 id="assistance">Assistance</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.lakecountyil.gov/Veterans/Assistance/Pages/default.aspx">This section</a> required the most work because very little of this information was available on the original website.  We wrote, rewrote, and reorganized everything into meaningful categories.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-vac">About the VAC</h3>

<p>I learned even more about Sharepoint while developing the <a href="http://www.lakecountyil.gov/Veterans/About/Pages/default.aspx">About section</a>.  The About section lists agendas, minutes, and reports from various meetings and the staff had issues remembering how to appropriately post PDFs to their website.  To ease their work load, I used a webpart to list tagged documents in a specific order.</p>

<h3 id="affiliated-groups">Affiliated Groups</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.lakecountyil.gov/Veterans/Affiliates/Pages/default.aspx">The content on Affiliated Groups</a> was easy to organize.  It is primarily made of links to the affiliated groups, though there are actual pages if the group submitted a write-up.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>When we showed the finished product to the <abbr title="Veterans Assistance Commission">VAC</abbr>, they asked if we could make it live today.  I call that a rousing success.</p>

<p>Though I still have issues with Sharepoint as an external website <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>, it did provide solutions to the content editors problems.</p>
