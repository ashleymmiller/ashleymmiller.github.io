<p><em>This is a backdated post.</em></p>

<p><a href="/images/alc_old.jpg"><img src="/images/alc_old.jpg" class="right half" alt="Old front page" /></a>The original Alert Lake County website was located on a server that the county's emergency response team could not access without IT's help.  In the case of an emergency, that extra time was unacceptable.  The website was moved to the current Sharepoint installation and we took that opportunity to redesign and update each and every page.</p>

<p>As always, creating pages within the county requires that we work within the current overall layout of the county pages.  I cannot change the top navigation or the footer, but I can control the design of the content area.</p>

<h2 id="the-front-page">The Front Page</h2>

<p>The front page was supposed to be a landing page for everything <abbr title="Alert Lake County">ALC</abbr> had to offer, including social media.  </p>

<p>The weather app updates for Waukegan, IL, not the user's location, because we found that its ability to locate an individual was off.  Though we were in Waukegan, it kept displaying weather for Winthrop Harbor.  The image next to the weather app displays an image of the seasonal weather threat and links to the appropriate response page.</p>

<p>The two black sections in the middle link to almost every page on the website, divided into two categories.  The category divisions were from the original site.</p>

<p>The bottom two sections link to all of the social media and related websites and also displays the most recent tweets from the <abbr title="Alert Lake County">ALC</abbr> twitter.</p>

<p>There's also a hidden section on the front page that displays emergency information.  It can easily be unhidden by anyone who has permission to edit the page.</p>

<h2 id="emergency-prep-and-response">Emergency Prep. and Response</h2>

<p><a href="/images/alc_1.jpg"><img src="/images/alc_1.jpg" class="right half" alt="Old front page" /></a><a href="/images/alc_2.jpg"><img src="/images/alc_2.jpg" class="left half" alt="Old front page" /></a></p>

<p>Each section had articles already available.  We expanded this information where necessary, updated it, and added links to related videos and other county websites.</p>
