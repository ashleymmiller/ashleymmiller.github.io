<p><em>This is a backdated post.</em></p>

<p>Very shortly after beginning my job at <a href="http://www.lakecountyil.gov/">Lake County</a>, I told my boss that my goal was to get Lake County a <a href="http://www.govtech.com/cdg/digital-government-achievement/">GovTech award</a>.  Redesigning the front page is the first step towards that goal.</p>

<h2 id="the-old">The Old</h2>

<p><a href="/images/lcilfront_old.jpg"><img src="/images/lcilfront_old.jpg" class="right half" alt="Old front page" /></a> The old layout was a mishmash of icons and images and styles and while it kind of contained a whole bunch of information, it was missing context.  It was definitely ugly.  The image to the right is a screenshot from the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> and though some of the images are broken, it definitely captures the overwhelming feeling of the old front page.</p>

<h2 id="the-new">The New</h2>

<h3 id="the-tabs">The Tabs</h3>

<p>The initial sketches were primarily inspired by GovTech winner <a href="http://www.acgov.org/">Alameda County, CA</a>.  We wanted to create tabs so that we could still have a lot of information on the main page, without overwhelming the visitors.</p>

<p>We used statistics from <a href="http://siteimprove.com/">Siteimprove</a> to determine what exactly should exist on the front page.  The main thing we ended up removing was the slideshow.  In about a year, each slideshow story had only gotten tens of hits, out of over a million visitors. Due to politics, there were some things we couldn't get rid of entirely, but we could move them.  </p>

<p>We used those same statistics to help us determine what those tabs should be broken down into.  Ultimately, we ended up with News, County Board, Property Tax, Jobs &amp; Doing Business, Services, Connect, and Transparency.  Most of the links were reorganized into those categories and then we added a lot more.  </p>

<p>We ended up with a lot more information, but also a lot more context.  For example, one of the old links said "Transparency/OpenGov".  There was no context to what OpenGov meant, even when paired with Transparency.  The new tab now describes transparency initiatives and provides links to all of the items mentioned.</p>

<h3 id="top-10-searches-whats-trending-and-featured-videos">Top 10 Searches, What's Trending, and Featured Videos</h3>

<p>The bottom bar replaced the red sidebar from the old layout.  The information was expanded.  Top 10 Searches is kind of self-explanatory and is manually updated once a week.  What's Trending describes new initiatives in the county.  (This one could be better named, I think.)  And Featured Videos is also self-explanatory.</p>

<h3 id="header-and-footer">Header and Footer</h3>

<p>What I could do personally with the Header and Footer was limited.  Changes were either mocked-up in Photoshop or coded quickly with Notepad and then handed off to the Sharepoint admin for final changes.  We wanted to make the search bar more prominent, add a pop-up for people to sign up for all newsletters available in the county, and we wanted to expand the footer.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What's Next?</h2>

<p>I'm currently in the process of condensing the top navigation so that users do not have to hover through many layers of drop-down menus.  We've also put in a request for funding for a new <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> that gets us away from Sharepoint.  That will also give us the opportunity to completely redo the layout, which will only get us closer </p>
